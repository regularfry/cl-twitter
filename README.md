CL-Twitter
==========

An almost trivial Twitter library. It uses Drakma for all the webby bits, and CL-JSON
to encode and decode all the data.

Usage to follow. This library should not be considered complete in any sense - for a
start, I haven''t fixed the asdf packaging yet.

That being said the LICENSE will be MIT.
